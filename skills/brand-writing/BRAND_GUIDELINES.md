### Replit in 1000 characters

Replit turns your ideas into apps, fast. Anyone—from beginners to seasoned developers—can build and publish fully-functional, full-stack apps directly from their browser, with zero setup. Use Agent to generate entire applications from a single prompt, or craft beautiful interfaces with our Visual Editor that writes clean code for you. Our built-in tools, including databases and one-click publishing, streamline the entire process from concept to launch. Replit is a collaborative platform where you can work with others in real-time, fork existing projects, and learn from a community of millions. Apps are the new websites, and Replit empowers everyone to become a creator of software, not just a consumer. Go from "why doesn't this app exist?" to building it yourself.

## Replit & vibe coding

Vibe coding is a modern approach to software creation where you lean on AI agents to write most of the code. Vibe coding allows you to act as a product manager or director, guiding the AI with natural language to build and iterate on your application. It's the evolution from simple code completion to generating entire, full-stack applications from a single prompt.

However, writing the code is only one part of building an app. You still need to configure databases, add authentication, manage security to prevent exposing API keys, and figure out how to take your project from a local environment to a live URL on the internet.

This is where Replit shines. Replit is the platform that handles all the hard parts surrounding vibe coding. Agent doesn't just write code; it configures your entire environment. Our all-in-one platform provides databases, object storage, and secure secret management out of the box. When you're ready, you can publish your app with a single click. Replit makes vibe coding not just possible, but practical and secure.

## Key brand messages

### The Fastest Way to Build

Replit is the fastest way to go from idea to live application. Create with natural language using Agent, modify with Assistant, or build visually with our Visual Editor—all without setup or installation.

### All-in-One Platform

Replit provides everything you need in one place: cloud-hosted development environment, production-grade databases, secure authentication, object storage, and one-click publishing. Focus on your idea, not on wiring together different services.

### Safe by Default

Building with AI requires confidence in security. Replit provides secure authentication with Replit Auth, scans for vulnerabilities before publishing, and protects critical files from accidental modification. Create with confidence.

### Zero Setup

Start building immediately in your browser. Agent creates entire development environments from prompts. No installation, no configuration—just ideas to applications.

### AI-Powered Development

Agent builds full-stack applications from natural language descriptions. Assistant makes targeted improvements and adds features. Go from zero to app with just natural language.

### Visual Creation

Import designs from Figma, Lovable, and Bolt with Replit Import. Refine them with our Visual Editor by selecting elements and modifying them directly, while clean code is generated automatically.

### Collaborative by Design

Work with others in real-time, share projects instantly, and learn from a community of millions. Collaborate in shared workspaces with live updates and communication tools.

## Product-specific messaging

### Agent

Agent is our AI developer that builds and grows your app. Describe your idea in natural language, and Agent will transform it into a full-stack application. It can set up your environment, install dependencies, design database structures, and integrate complex APIs. You can provide extra context by attaching files or linking to URLs. As your project evolves, continue to chat with Agent to add new features, make changes, and debug issues. Agent creates checkpoints, allowing you to roll back to previous versions of your app if needed.

### Assistant

Assistant is your AI-powered partner for improving and polishing your app. It has two modes: Basic and Advanced. In Basic mode, which is free for all users, you can get code explanations, autocomplete suggestions, and recommendations. Advanced mode allows Assistant to directly modify your app by adding features, fixing bugs, and updating packages. It proposes changes in "edit requests" that you can review, approve, and undo. You can also interact with Assistant directly in the file editor to explain, modify, or debug selected code.

### replit.md

`replit.md` is a special configuration file that customizes Agent's behavior in your project. Agent automatically creates this file in your project's root directory using proven best practices, then uses it to understand your preferences, coding style, and project architecture. You can define coding standards, specify your preferred tech stack, set communication preferences, and provide project context to help Agent build exactly what you want. As your project evolves, Agent can update your `replit.md` file to reflect new patterns and decisions.

### Visual Editor

The Visual Editor allows you to edit your app's UI directly in the preview. Select any element to modify text, update images, or adjust styles like padding and color. Changes are previewed live and can be saved to your source code instantly. For more complex edits, the Visual Editor works with Agent to ensure your changes are applied accurately. You can also jumpstart your project with Replit Import to bring in designs from Figma, Lovable, or Bolt.

### Preview

The Preview tool gives you an instant, live view of your web app as you build it. When you run your app, it opens a preview in your workspace that looks and feels just like a web browser. You can interact with your app, test its responsiveness on different screen sizes, and use built-in developer tools to diagnose issues.

### Replit Apps

A Replit App is a cloud-hosted project that contains all your code, data, and assets in a secure, isolated environment. With Replit Apps, you get a zero-setup development experience with pre-configured environments, taking you from idea to a published application with a unique URL in minutes. You can create them from scratch, with AI, or by using a template. They are automatically saved to the cloud, have built-in version control, and can be made public or private.

### Mobile App

The Replit Mobile App for iOS and Android is a full-featured development environment that puts the power of Replit in your pocket. With an interface optimized for touchscreens, you can use the same workspace tools as the web version to create, run, and publish your apps from anywhere. You can also collaborate with others in real-time and use templates to jumpstart your projects.

### Workspace

The Replit Workspace is an all-in-one, browser-based environment where you can access all of Replit's tools to create, run, and publish your apps. It has a customizable interface and a feature-rich code editor that streamlines the development process. You can build full-stack apps with AI, collaborate with others in real-time, and publish to the cloud, all from a single tab.

## Marketing principles

### Referring to our "users"

People who use Replit are *builders* and *creators*. While many are professional *developers*, our platform is for anyone with an idea. Use language that is inclusive to all skill levels. *Builders*, *creators*, and *developers* are all acceptable. Avoid generic terms like *users* or *makers*.

*Replit Core members* are individuals who pay for membership.

Examples:

- A Builder Profile blog post may be about someone on a free or paid account
- A Replit Core member may have a Builder Profile written about them but are still a member

### Messaging should help builders understand

- How does it make a developer's life easier or better? What does it unlock for them?
- Why should a developer use it?
- Why should a developer choose it over competitive offers?
- What type of product or feature are we offering?
- What does it do?

### Brand experience

While writing, ask yourself the following questions:

- Is it true?
- Relevant?
- Interesting?
- Clear?

## Do's and don'ts

### Do

- **Be helpful and inspiring.** Show people what they can create. Provide clear, step-by-step guides for building cool projects, from simple bots to full-fledged apps.
  - *Example: "Want to build your own website? Here's how you can do it in 5 minutes with Replit."*
- **Empower everyone to create.** Our mission is to democratize software creation. Use language that is inclusive and encouraging to people of all skill levels.
  - *Example: "You don't need a computer science degree to build software. Just describe your idea to Agent, and watch it come to life."*
- **Be clear and accessible.** Avoid overly technical jargon. When you must use a technical term, explain it simply. Frame concepts in ways that both beginners and experts can understand.
  - *Example: "Your app runs in the cloud, which means you can access and work on it from anywhere. For our technical users, this is powered by Google Cloud's infrastructure, giving you reliability and scale."*
- **Be honest and transparent.** Only make claims that can be substantiated. Be factual about the product in your messaging.
  - *Example: "Since its initial launch, our secret scanning has prevented more than 500 API keys from being accidentally exposed."*
- **Connect features to benefits.** Focus on the "what" and "why." What does this feature allow someone to do that they couldn't before?
  - *Example: "With Replit, you can build and launch an app from one place. This means less time wrestling with configuration and more time bringing your idea to life."*
- **Talk about results, not just features.** The magic is in what people create, not just the tools they use.
  - *Example: "Agent doesn't just write code; it builds working apps. Go from a simple prompt to a live application that you can share with the world."*
- **Be friendly and encouraging.** Replit's voice is authentic, friendly, and inviting. We're your partner in creation, whether you're building your first app or your hundredth.
- **Use "you" in marketing communications.** Speak directly to the builder.
  - *Example: "Build and publish your own AI transcription app in 3 minutes on Replit."*

### Don't

- **Exaggerate.** Avoid superlatives like "best" or "easiest" unless they can be substantiated.
  - *Example: "The world's most powerful vibe coding platform"*
- **Make unrealistic promises.** Don't use gimmicky hooks that mislead people.
  - *Example: "Want to make a million dollars in a year? Publish an app on Replit."*
- **Focus on learning over creating.** We are a platform for building, not just an educational tool. Frame our value around what people can create.
  - *Example: Instead of 'Learn to code,' say 'Build your first app.' We empower people by helping them do, not just study.*
- **Use excessive emojis.** Use them sparingly to add personality, not as a substitute for clear communication.
- **Use first person plural.** Avoid "we," "us," "our." Write in second person ("you").

# Style Guide

## Documentation writing principles

Based on Vale configuration and actual documentation patterns, follow these principles:

### Writing style

- **Active voice**: Use active voice instead of passive voice
- **Concise language**: Prefer shorter, clearer alternatives to wordy phrases
- **Sentence length**: Keep sentences under 25 words when possible
- **Oxford commas**: Always use Oxford commas in lists
- **Em-dashes**: Use em-dashes (—) without spaces around them

### Capitalization

#### Titles & headings

For all headings, titles, and subheadings, use sentence casing, where the first word is capitalized, and all other words besides proper nouns are lowercase.

*Example: Improving the inline Replit AI experience*

### Technical elements

#### Code

When referencing a code block or a line of code inside of writing, use code formatting. This especially applies when using Markdown.

In Markdown, indicate inline code by putting backticks (`) around parts of a line:

`insert a line of code here`

If inserting more than one line of code, use code blocks with language specification:

```javascript
console.log("Hello, world!");
```

**Special filenames:**
- Always format `replit.md` with backticks when referencing the filename
- Use lowercase: `replit.md` not `Replit.md` or `REPLIT.MD`

#### UI elements

Use **bold** when referring to UI elements.

Example: Select the **Publish** button.

Refer to UI elements by their position on screen, and refrain from using "click" to refer to the selection of an element. Instead, use "select."

Example: Select the **Publish** button in the upper-right corner of the Workspace.

#### Images and screenshots

Use HTML `<img>` tags instead of Markdown image syntax for all images. Always include descriptive alt text.

**Screenshot requirements:**
- Use high-resolution screenshots (minimum 1200px wide for desktop views)
- Capture screenshots in dark mode unless specifically documenting light mode features
- Include sufficient context around the UI element being demonstrated
- Ensure text is legible and UI elements are clearly visible
- Use consistent browser/window styling across screenshots
- Crop screenshots to focus on relevant content while maintaining context

**Alt text guidelines:**
- Describe what the image shows, not what it looks like
- Include relevant UI element names and their states
- Mention important text content visible in the image
- Keep descriptions concise but comprehensive
- Example: `<img src="/images/console-output.png" alt="Console tool showing successful publishing logs with green checkmarks" />`

### Accessibility requirements

**General accessibility:**
- Use sufficient color contrast (minimum 4.5:1 ratio for normal text)
- Don't rely solely on color to convey meaning
- Use descriptive link text instead of "click here" or "read more"
- Provide alternative text for all images and screenshots
- Use proper heading hierarchy (don't skip heading levels)
- Write in plain language and define technical terms when first introduced

**UI element descriptions:**
- Describe UI element locations for screen reader users
- Example: "Select the **Publish** button in the upper-right corner" instead of "Select the **Publish** button on the right"
- Include keyboard navigation instructions when relevant
- Specify what happens when actions are taken

**Content structure:**
- Use semantic markup (headings, lists, emphasis) correctly
- Ensure content is navigable without visual cues
- Provide context for time-sensitive information
- Use consistent terminology throughout documentation

### Date formatting

#### Absolute dates

If a precise date needs to be shown: format it with a 3-letter month code, 2-digit day, comma, and 4-digit year.

*Example: Jan 11, 2012 or Aug 28, 2099*

If it is the current year, consider not displaying the year.

*Example: If it's 2023, use Jan 12, not Jan 12, 2023*

#### Times

Spell am and pm in lowercase, without periods, except for noon and midnight, which should be presented verbatim (i.e., *12:00 noon*). If you need seconds, add them as you expect (i.e., *12:01:59 pm*).

### Punctuation

Use a serial comma (also known as an "Oxford comma") after the penultimate term in a list of terms. In the following example, the serial comma is the one after "explains": *Agent is an AI pair programmer that completes, generates, explains, and edits your code.*

Decide whether or not you're going to use periods at the end of bullet points. Be consistent with whatever you decide.

Use exclamation points sparingly.

### Links

Use inline links when possible, and refrain from using "here" as the linked word for accessibility reasons. Instead, describe the document to which you are linking.

### Numbers

Spell out numbers zero through nine. Use numerals for 10 and above. Use numerals for all measurements.

### Miscellaneous

When referring to creation, use the verb "Create" instead of the adjective "New." This is to be consistent with other areas of the product.

*Example: Create Repl*

When referring to a username in text, prepend the username with *@*.

*Example: @user894759847*

Use active voice over passive voice where possible.

When referring to Agent or Assistant, we do not use the word "the." Both products should be capitalized always.

*Example: Agent and Assistant are Replit's newest AI-powered tools*

We use em-dashes (—) over hyphens (-) except for hyphenated words. Em-dashes should not be surrounded by spaces.

*Example: Our great-grandmother is a remarkable woman—she's overcome much in her life.*

### Publishing Terminology

#### Core Terminology

##### Primary Terms
- **"Publishing"** - Use when referring to the deployment feature or process
- **"Published App(s)"** - Use when referring to active/live deployments
- **"Publish"** - The preferred verb for making apps live and accessible

##### Context-Based Usage

###### For Isolated Words
Choose "publishing" or "published app" based on whether you're discussing the action/feature or the resulting state.

###### For Full Sentences and Phrases
Rethink the entire phrase rather than doing direct word substitution. Consider the user's intent and choose language that feels natural.

#### Usage Examples

##### Publish (Verb)
- **Present Tense**: "Click here to **publish** your app."
- **Past Tense**: "You have successfully **published** your project."
- **Continuous**: "Your app is now **publishing**. This may take a few moments."

##### Published (Adjective)
- "View your **published** app at this URL."
- "A list of your **published** projects."

##### Publishing (Noun/Gerund)
- "**Publishing** is the final step to make your app live."
- "The **publishing** process includes selecting a deployment type."

#### What to Avoid

##### Incorrect Usage
- ❌ "Delete published app"
- ❌ "Deployment failed"
- ❌ "View published app details"

##### Correct Alternatives
- ✅ "Unpublish app"
- ✅ "Publishing failed" or "Failed to publish"
- ✅ "View app details" (when already in published apps context)

#### Special Cases

##### Deployment Type Exception
Use "deployment" only when referring to "deployment type" in advanced settings. Deployment type refers to the technology used to publish an app.

**Example**: "Select a deployment type for your app before publishing."

#### Key Principle

Prioritize natural, intuitive language over mechanical word replacement. The goal is user-friendly terminology that clearly communicates the action or state without awkward phrasing.

#### Rationale

"Publish" is user-centric language that frames the action around the builder's goal: making their app public and shareable. It's a familiar term from contexts like blogging and social media, implying "making something available to an audience."

### Pricing and billing

Never include inline prices in documentation. Import pricing information from snippets to ensure accuracy and consistency across all documentation.

## Marketing content formatting

### Headlines and messaging

**Headlines:**
- Use sentence case for marketing headlines
- Keep concise and benefit-focused
- Lead with value proposition
- Example: "Build your first app in minutes"

**Marketing copy formatting:**
- Use **bold** for key benefits and important terms
- Use *italics* for emphasis and product names
- Avoid technical jargon unless explaining features
- Keep paragraphs short for readability

### Abbreviations in marketing

**First use rule:**
- Spell out acronyms on first use in marketing materials
- Example: "Artificial Intelligence (AI)"
- Subsequent uses can be abbreviated

**Marketing-relevant acronyms:**
- AI (Artificial Intelligence)
- API (Application Programming Interface)
- CLI (Command Line Interface)
- UI (User Interface)
- UX (User Experience)

**Formatting standards:**
- No periods in acronyms: AI, not A.I.
- Use all caps for technical acronyms
- Spell out when targeting non-technical audiences

### Currency and pricing

**Pricing display:**
- Use $ symbol before amounts: $19/month, $199/year
- For cents, use decimal: $1.99, not $1.⁹⁹
- No space between currency symbol and number
- Use "Free" instead of "$0"

**Percentages:**
- No space between number and percent sign: 50% faster
- Use "percent" in formal marketing copy
- Use numerals with % in headlines and CTAs

### Product and feature names

**Replit products:**
- Always capitalize Replit product names
- Use consistent naming: Agent, Assistant, Visual Editor
- Don't use "the" before product names

**Competitor references:**
- Use proper capitalization for competitor names
- Avoid direct comparisons unless substantiated
- Focus on Replit benefits rather than competitor weaknesses

### Marketing lists and bullets

**Benefit lists:**
- Start with action verbs: "Build", "Publish", "Create"
- Keep items parallel in structure
- Use consistent punctuation
- Prioritize most compelling benefits first

**Feature lists:**
- Use bullet points for feature lists
- Keep items concise (under 10 words)
- Focus on user benefits, not technical specs
- Use active voice

### Customer quotes and testimonials

**Quote formatting:**
- Use curly quotes for customer testimonials: "This changed everything"

- Use action-oriented language: "Start Building", "Try Free"
- Keep text short (2-3 words when possible)
- Use title case: "Get Started", "Learn More"
- Bold formatting for emphasis: **Start Free Trial**

**CTA copy:**
- Create urgency without being pushy
- Focus on benefits: "Build your app today"
- Use second person: "Start your project"
- Include clear next steps

### Social media and digital

**Hashtags:**
- Never use hashtags in Replit marketing content
- Focus on clear, descriptive copy instead of hashtag trends
- Let the content speak for itself without hashtag clutter

**Username mentions:**
- Use @ symbol: @replit
- Lowercase for platform handles
- Verify correct handles before publishing

### International marketing

**Global considerations:**
- Avoid region-specific references unless targeted
- Use inclusive language for global audience
- Consider currency conversion for international markets
- Adapt time references to target markets

**Localization:**
- Use clear, simple language for translation
- Avoid idioms and cultural references
- Keep sentences concise for better translation
- Consider right-to-left languages in design
