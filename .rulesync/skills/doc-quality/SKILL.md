# Documentation Quality Review Skill

This skill helps you review and improve documentation using proven best practices.

## Quick Quality Checklist

When reviewing documentation, check:

### ✅ Easy to Skim
- [ ] Content split into sections with clear titles
- [ ] Informative titles (not abstract nouns like "Results")
- [ ] Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences ideal)
- [ ] Topic sentences start paragraphs
- [ ] Important takeaways up front
- [ ] Bullets and tables used frequently
- [ ] Important text bolded

### ✅ Well Written
- [ ] Simple sentences (under 25 words)
- [ ] Active voice throughout
- [ ] No ambiguous phrasing
- [ ] Consistent terminology
- [ ] Demonstrative pronouns avoided ("this" → specific term)

### ✅ Broadly Helpful
- [ ] Simple language (non-native speakers can understand)
- [ ] No unexplained abbreviations
- [ ] Solutions to potential problems included
- [ ] Specific, accurate terminology
- [ ] Code examples are general and exportable
- [ ] No bad habits demonstrated

## Review Focus Areas

1. **Clarity**: Can someone new to the topic understand this?
2. **Accuracy**: Are all technical details correct?
3. **Completeness**: Are there gaps that would confuse readers?
4. **Tone**: Does it match Replit's brand voice?
5. **Links**: Are all references valid and helpful?

## Common Issues to Fix

- **Long paragraphs** → Split into shorter chunks
- **Passive voice** → Convert to active voice
- **"Click here" links** → Use descriptive link text
- **Missing context** → Add brief explanations
- **Jargon** → Replace with simpler terms or define first use
- **Buried information** → Move important points to the top

4. Balance criticism with recognition of what works well
