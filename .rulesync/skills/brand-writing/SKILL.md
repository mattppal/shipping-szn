# Replit Brand Writing Skill

This skill helps you write content that matches Replit's brand voice and style.

## Core Brand Voice

Replit's voice is **professional yet approachable**, **user-empowering**, and **action-oriented**.

### Key Characteristics

- **Direct and clear**: Use active voice, imperative statements, and concise language
- **User-focused**: Always write in second person ("you") rather than first person plural ("we")
- **Encouraging**: Empower builders to create without being condescating
- **Technically precise**: Provide exact instructions and accurate information

## Quick Reference

When writing content:

1. **Use active voice** - "Agent builds applications" not "Applications are built by Agent"
2. **Write to "you"** - Focus on what the user/builder can do
3. **Keep it simple** - Short sentences, clear language, avoid jargon
4. **Be honest** - Only make substantiated claims
5. **Connect features to benefits** - Show what users can accomplish

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- ❌ Don't exaggerate ("best", "easiest" without proof)
- ❌ Don't use excessive emojis
- ❌ Don't use first person plural ("we", "us", "our")
- ❌ Don't focus on learning over creating

## Capitalization Rules

Always capitalize these Replit-specific terms:
- Replit, Agent, Assistant, Visual Editor
- Workspace, Console, Shell, Preview
- Deployments, Database, Object Storage
- Replit Auth, Replit Core, Replit Teams

Use lowercase for `replit.md` (the config file).
